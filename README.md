# Churn-Prediction-Model
PROBLEM STATEMENT
The focus on customer churn is to determinate the customers who are at risk of leaving and if possible on the analysis whether those customers are worth retaining. The churn analysis is highly dependent on the definition of the customer churn. The business sector and customer relationship affects the outcome how churning customers are detected. Example in credit card business customers can easily start using another credit card, so the only indicator for the previous card company is declining transactions. 
So the project's goal is, given a data of spend and count per account can we create a supervised learning binary classification model which will predict if given account is at risk of churn of not.
